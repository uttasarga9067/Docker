# Project Docker
Designing a Python Script to get details of the Files present in a Directory.
First Step is to Create and Launch a Docker Container and Install Python in your virtual machine so that the Code which We write in Python gets executed with the help of the Docker Container.
There are certain text file present in a given location (Change the location in the script according to the location where your files are present).
The Python Script should be able to list all the name of the files present in the location.
It should read the file and count the number of words which are there in all the given files.
It should list the name of the Maximum words of the file and Print the Name and IP address of your Machine.
When we create a zip file of our container, it should be able to run by using the docker run command and then provide output as stated above.
